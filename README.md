# TreeHacks 2023 -- HaulSwap
This projected utilized smart contracts to automate transactions between truck drivers and companies. Payments are automatically sent to drivers once completed and companies send their money to drivers upon completon. This is all done through smart contracts (solidity). To optimize the pathing for drivers, we used MCTS to go through different nodes that are placed on the way to the final destination. An improvement would most likely be a robust heuristic using A star.

Worked with Rohan P, Amitoj S, and Nithik Y
