# Web3/Hackathon Projects
This repository has the links to various hackathon projects I've worked on in the past.

# TreeHacks 2023 -- HaulSwap
This projected utilized smart contracts to automate transactions between truck drivers and companies. Payments are automatically sent to drivers once completed and companies send their money to drivers upon completon. This is all done through smart contracts (solidity). To optimize the pathing for drivers, we used MCTS to go through different nodes that are placed on the way to the final destination. An improvement would most likely be a robust heuristic using A star.

Worked with Rohan P, Amitoj S, and Nithik Y

# TreeHacks 2024 -- VeriVote
We utilized a Rust backend, Python Client, and web3 protocol (QED Protocol) to create a decentralized platform to vote on proposals, finalize, and delegate votes. All the users' functions are taken from the python client, executed and sent from the rust backend. The QED protocol is built on the layer 2 blockchain and utilizes recursive zero-knowledge proofs snarks to provide security without the compromise of information. Our next steps include creating a functional UI, finding ways of authenticating users, and improvements to the system infrastructure.

Worked with Rohan T, Jameson C, Tanay A
